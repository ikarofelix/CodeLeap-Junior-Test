## Required:

- ✔️ Targeted to consumer, not developers.
- ✔️ Exactly like the design, but with some improvements at my own risk. ;)
- ✔️ Consistency, spaces and symmetrical components.
- ✔️ Usability, accessibility.
- ✔️ Attention to details.
- ✔️ Keeping it simple with objects, results oriented and a good folder structure.
- ✔️ Deliver quickly.

---

## Bonus:

- ✔️ Responsiveness.
- ✔️ Permanent login and logout solution (Used the same login option the design instructed, the username is being saved in localStorage, with a logout option in the posts page).
- ✔️ Pagination or infinite scrolling.
- ✔️ Animations, transitions and hover effects.

OTHER IDEAS:

- ✔️ Redux Toolkit to have a cleaner and more effective redux store with no need for actions and reducers created separately.
- ✔️ Redux Saga to manage asynchronous functions.
- ✔️ Single page application for better user experience.

## Time spent:
